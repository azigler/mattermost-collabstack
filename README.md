## How to Build a Custom Collaboration Stack with Open Source Software

### Presenters:

> Software development teams have unique needs that general-purpose collaboration tools aren’t designed to meet. The challenges imposed while managing releases, responding to incidents, resolving bugs, and managing CI/CD pipelines are unique to software developers. These technical teams need a hub with team messaging, file share, screen share, process automation, and project management. And this hub needs to connect with all of their favorite toolchains. This workshop will show you how to use GitLab and Mattermost to set up an example collaboration environment with other tools like Grafana, Nextcloud, and Wiki.js. Powered by Instruqt, free experimentation on the sandbox environment is encouraged – spend the workshop exploring technical and operational workflows that you can replicate for your teams in the future with open source software. To participate, all you need is a computer with internet access, familiarity with a terminal and code editor – the provided personal sandbox environment contains everything else.
