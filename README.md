### Presenters:
 - [Andrew Zigler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewzigler/): Developer Advocate @ Mattermost

> Software development teams have unique needs and desires that general-purpose collaboration tools arenâ€™t always designed to meet. The challenges imposed while managing releases, responding to incidents, identifying and resolving bugs, and managing CI/CD pipelines are unique to software developers, and as such, the tools they use should be custom-fit to their needs. The great news is that there is a growing list of collaboration software tailored to the specific needs of software developers, and much of that software is open source! This workshop will show you how to use popular, open source software to set up a collaboration environment that helps your software development team reduce noise and focus on the work that matters most.
